# Addition of Two Numbers Web App

This simple web app allows users to input two numbers, send a request to the backend, calculate the sum, and view the result. The backend is expected to be running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/sum?num1=10&num2=20.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

2. Enter the first number in the "Enter the first number" input field.

3. Enter the second number in the "Enter the second number" input field.

4. Click the "Add" button to send a request to the backend and calculate the sum.

5. The result from the backend will be displayed in the field.

## Backend Setup

Make sure your backend server is running at http://127.0.0.1:3000. If it's running on a different address, update the URL in the JavaScript code accordingly.
